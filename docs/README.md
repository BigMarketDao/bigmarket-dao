## Rethinking Speculation, Empowering Communities

{% hint style="info" %}
### **Bitcoin Backed, Community Focused**
{% endhint %}

Speculation is a fundamental human instinct‚Äîfrom the earliest recorded examples - drawing tiles - described in the Book of Song, \~2000 B.C. Fast forward to the current day and the Traditional Betting Industry has emerged as a dominant, highly efficient and centralised machine for extracting **huge profits** from everyday people and concentrating wealth in the hands of a few. **BigMarket is here to challenge this story.**

We believe prediction markets can be used to express peoples desire to speculate while also **giving back** to the communities that create and use them. BigMarket is a **decentralized, AI-driven prediction market** that **puts people first**, recycling market profits into **grassroots communities, independent creators, and real-world causes**.

Unlike traditional betting markets, prediction markets offer [real societal value](https://people.duke.edu/~qc2/BA532/2002%20AER%20Morris%20and%20Shin.pdf). They are powerful tools for aggregating dispersed knowledge and surfacing collective intelligence‚Äî outperforming opinion polls and expert forecasts. By allowing individuals to back beliefs with stakes, prediction markets incentivize accuracy and reveal hidden insights. This mechanism has been shown to help prioritize promising scientific research directions ([PNAS study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1516179112)) and even serves as the basis for novel governance models like futarchy, where policy decisions are guided by market predictions rather than polls or ideology ([Hanson's Futarchy](https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html)).

Imagine:\
üé∂ **Music markets** that **fund emerging musicians.**\
üåç **Climate markets** where **profits drive sustainability projects.**\
üì∞ **Geopolitical prediction markets** that **support independent journalism.**

Built on **Bitcoin for security**, BigMarket ensures **fairness, and transparency**‚Äîwhile unlocking a future where **both users and AI agents** can autonomously create and resolve markets.

This isn‚Äôt just about betting. **This is about changing the economics of speculation.** üöÄ
