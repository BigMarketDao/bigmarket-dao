## Rethinking Speculation, Empowering Communities

{% hint style="info" %}
### **Bitcoin Backed Community Orientated**
{% endhint %}

Speculation is a fundamental human instinct—from the earliest recorded examples - drawing tiles - described in the Book of Song, \~2000 B.C. Fast forward to the current day and the Traditional Betting Industry has emerged as a dominant, highly efficient and centralised machine for extracting **huge profits** from everyday people and concentrating wealth in the hands of a few. **BigMarket is here to challenge this story.**

We believe prediction markets can be used to express peoples desire to speculate while also **giving back** to the communities that create and use them. BigMarket is a **decentralized, AI-driven prediction market** that **puts people first**, recycling market profits into **grassroots communities, independent creators, and real-world causes**.

Imagine:\
🎶 **Music markets** that **fund emerging musicians.**\
🌍 **Climate markets** where **profits drive sustainability projects.**\
📰 **Geopolitical prediction markets** that **support independent journalism.**

Built on **Bitcoin for security**, BigMarket ensures **fairness, and transparency**—while unlocking a future where **both users and AI agents** can autonomously create and resolve markets.

This isn’t just about betting. **This is about changing the economics of speculation.** 🚀
