# Reputation & Rewards

## Why Earn Reputation on BigMarket?

BigMarket isn't just another prediction market — it's a project that rewards utility, not hype.

Every time you engage — by staking on markets, contributing to governance, or just showing up early with signal — you earn **reputation tokens**. These aren’t fluff points. They're claimable for a share of the DAO's monthly BIG token distribution.

**How it works:**\
Each month, the DAO releases a fixed pool of **10,000 BIG**. That pool gets distributed to wallets based on how much reputation they’ve earned. No insider allocations, no favouritism — just pure, on-chain participation.

### What’s the Point of BIG?

BIG is the project's utility token. You can think of it as your on-chain stake in how the system evolves:

* **Participate in governance**
* **Propose or moderate markets**
* **Earn more reputation, and more BIG**

It’s a feedback loop: contribute, earn rep, claim BIG, use BIG to deepen your influence.

## How the BIG Reward Protocol Works

#### Fair. Finite. Self Funding.

BigMarket rewards participants with BIG tokens based on how much reputation they earn through actual engagement — staking, predicting, building, governing. But unlike many projects that inflate endlessly to drive participation, BigMarket takes a different route: the reward system is **capped, transparent, and designed to sustain itself.**

#### 1. Capped Initial Allocation: 1.5% of Supply

At launch, the DAO mints **1.5% of the total BIG supply** (150,000 BIG) into a dedicated **treasury vault**.

This treasury is the sole source of BIG rewards. Every month, a portion of that pool (e.g. 5,000–10,000 BIG) is distributed to wallets that hold reputation tokens. The size of your claim is proportional to your rep — earned by verifiable, on-chain participation.

No ongoing minting. No hidden emissions. Just a fixed pot.

#### 2. Sustainable by Design

Our reward system don't solely rely on this 1.5% mint - to keep things moving we also swap fees earned from market winners back into BIG

**The more active the markets, the more sustainable the rewards.**

#### 3. Deflation-Resistant

Rewards are funded by a fixed allocation + DAO earnings, there’s no inflation pressure baked into the system. This preserves BIG’s value as a utility and governance token — not just a faucet token you dump.

And because only the DAO (or its extensions) can transfer from the treasury, there's full transparency and on-chain accountability for how rewards are handled.

Most “reward” systems are really just slow-motion inflation. BigMarket flips the script:

* You **earn** reputation by doing something useful
* You **claim** BIG from a fixed pot
* The system **replenishes** itself through actual market activity
* And the DAO controls the levers at every stage

No hype. No tricks. Just aligned incentives, on-chain rules, and a system designed to last.

## Earning Reputation (and Why It’s Tiered)

Reputation isn’t one-size-fits-all. It’s tiered — tracked with non-transferable **semi-fungible tokens (SFTs)** that reflect what kind of participant you are. These SFTs are compliant with [SIP-013](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-013/sip-013-semi-fungible-token-standard.md), and act like soul-bound XP:

* Stake early or accurately? You get rewarded.
* Launch quality markets? That earns you more.
* Contribute to governance or dev efforts? That counts too.

As your reputation grows, you unlock more privileges — from governance access to moderation powers.

### A Note on Fairness

Yes, early users have an advantage. That’s true in almost every system. But BigMarket is DAO-governed, and we’ve thought about long-term fairness.

Reputation **can decay** if you're inactive. That means consistent contributors stay relevant — and wallets that just farm once and disappear won't soak up rewards forever.&#x20;
