# BigMarket DeFi

Our scalar prediction markets are set up on any regular  schedule and take a range either side of the current price point on BTC/STX/ETH.

They can run for a day or a month or longer and traders can stake on the markets taking long / short / neutral positions on price.

These markets resolve on-chain (via Pyth on-chain oracle) - **no human intervention is required**.

The DAO can empower any entity to become a Market Creator and thereby create funding channels for partner projects in a fully decentralised manner.

### ✅ BigMarket Fee Model

Our fee structure is decentralized, flexible, and aligned with stakeholder incentives in a way that is truly distinct from traditional OTC and Ethereum-based derivatives platforms;

* 🔑  **Governance-first**: All fees are on-chain, DAO/community-configurable.
* 🔑  **Winner-pays**: Most fees are charged on **successful predictions**, not on entry—minimizing friction.
* 🔑  **Modular incentives**: Encourages custom markets with aligned local incentives via creator-tuned Market Fund.
* 🔑  **No LPs needed**: Fee extraction doesn’t depend on liquidity providers like AMMs.
