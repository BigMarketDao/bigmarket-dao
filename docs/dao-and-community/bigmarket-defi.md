# BigMarket DeFi

Our scalar prediction markets are set up on any regular  schedule and take a range either side of the current price point on BTC/STX/ETH.

They can run for a day or a month or longer and traders can stake on the markets taking long / short / neutral positions on price.

These markets resolve on-chain (via Pyth on-chain oracle) - **no human intervention is required**.

BigMarket scalar prediction markets introduce a hybridized model that blends some of the most useful mechanics of both traditional OTC platforms and DeFi.

#### 🔄 BigMarket compared to traditional OTC Platforms:

| Aspect                  | Scalar Markets                            | Traditional OTC                                |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **Access**              | Open to anyone with STX/BTC/ETH           | Limited to institutional or accredited parties |
| **Settlement**          | Fully on-chain, rule-based                | Manual, off-chain, with counterparty risk      |
| **Duration**            | Flexible (1 day to multi-month)           | Often bespoke, negotiated per trade            |
| **Market Creation**     | Permissionless, recurring                 | Custom, opaque, and slow to set up             |
| **Transparency**        | Public and auditable                      | Private, often with limited disclosures        |

### ✅ BigMarket Fee Model

Our fee structure is decentralized, flexible, and aligned with stakeholder incentives in a way that is truly distinct from traditional OTC and Ethereum-based derivatives platforms;

* 🔑  **Governance-first**: All fees are on-chain, DAO/community-configurable.
* 🔑  **Winner-pays**: Most fees are charged on **successful predictions**, not on entry—minimizing friction.
* 🔑  **Modular incentives**: Encourages custom markets with aligned local incentives via creator-tuned Market Fund.
* 🔑  **No LPs needed**: Fee extraction doesn’t depend on liquidity providers like AMMs.
