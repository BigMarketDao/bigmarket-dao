# BigMarket DeFi

Our fully automated, scalar prediction markets are set up on any regular schedule and take a range either side of the current price point on BTC/STX/ETH/etc.

They can run for a day or a month or longer and traders can stake on the markets taking long / short / neutral positions on price.

These markets resolve on-chain (via Pyth on-chain oracle) - **no human intervention is required**.

The BigMarket DAO can empower an entity to become a Market Creator on the platform with its own treasury and fee structure, thereby creating funding channels for partner projects in a fully decentralised and incentive aligned ecosystem.

### **BigMarket vs DeFi & OTC Platforms**

BigMarket is a **fixed-sum prediction market**, not a traditional OTC desk or typical DeFi trading protocol.

On platforms like **Curve** or **dYdX**, trader payout is straightforward:

> **Net = Trade Result – Platform Fees**\
> Your result is independent of who else trades and relies on deep liquidity, provided by **LPs (Liquidity Providers)**. These platforms function continuously and deterministically—fees are known, and execution is fast, but detached from broader market dynamics.

By contrast, **BigMarket is zero-sum**. There’s **no liquidity requirement** up front.

> **Net = Share of Total Pot Won – Winner Fees**\
> Your payout depends on how many others took the same position as you—and how many didn’t. It's about conviction, not execution. The **distribution of stakes** across Long, Short, and Neutral outcomes determines how the pot is divided among winners.

This makes BigMarket somewhere between traditional prediction markets and vanilla trading venues.

### BigMarket Fee Model

Our fee structure is decentralized, flexible, and aligned with stakeholder incentives in a way that is truly distinct from traditional OTC and Ethereum-based derivatives platforms;

* 🔑  **Governance-first**: All fees are on-chain, DAO/community-configurable.
* 🔑  **Winner-pays**: Most fees are charged on **successful predictions**, not on entry—minimizing friction.
* 🔑  **Modular incentives**: Encourages custom markets with aligned local incentives via creator-tuned Market Fund.
* 🔑  **No LPs needed**: Fee extraction doesn’t depend on liquidity providers like AMMs.
