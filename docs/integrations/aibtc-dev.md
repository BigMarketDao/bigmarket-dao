# AIBTC DEV

Proposals for Integration with AIBTC project.&#x20;

### Main Options

1. **Integration A**: Separate core dao projects
   1. BigMarket dao token sale takes place independently
   2. integrations focus on using AIBTC agents to interract with prediction markets.
2. **Integration B**: BigMarket forks AIBTC DEV core dao
   1. BigMarket aligns with AIBTC token sale/distribution approach
   2. BigMarket aligns with AIBTC voting and proposal mechanisms
   3. BigMarket integrates prediction market contracts with forked doa contracts
3. **Integration C**: BigMarket integrates with AIBTC DEV core dao
   1. BigMarket integrates prediction contracts and submits PR to AIBTC DEV
   2. BigMarket and AIBTC DEV join forces

### Notes

**Integration A**

This is the current path but there risks. Bootstrapping this project is a big lift and is being done without funds to pay for contract audits, regulatory assessments etc.

**Integration B**

This approach de-risks some of the technical challenges through code reuse - although BigMarket anticipate needing to relax some of the constraints in the AIBTC DEV voting setup in order to react quickly during bootstrapping phase.

Another challenge is the liquidity needed to run a token sale via a DEX - a staged token sale is proposed to help support early stage development. \
\
Open to suggestion on how to make this work?

**Intragation C**

Open to discussion - Big Market aren't assuming this is viable given both teams on a separate trajectory and this would impact goto market plans on both sides.
