# BigMarket Reputation & Rewards

### Why Earn Reputation on BigMarket?

BigMarket isn't just another prediction market — it's a project that rewards utility, not hype.

Every time you engage — by staking on markets, contributing to governance, or just showing up early with signal — you earn **reputation tokens**. These aren’t fluff points. They're claimable for a share of the DAO's monthly BIG token distribution.

**How it works:**\
Each month, the DAO releases a fixed pool of **10,000 BIG**. That pool gets distributed to wallets based on how much reputation they’ve earned. No insider allocations, no favouritism — just pure, on-chain participation.

### What’s the Point of BIG?

BIG is the project's utility token. You can think of it as your on-chain stake in how the system evolves:

* **Participate in governance**
* **Propose or moderate markets**
* **Earn more reputation, and more BIG**

It’s a feedback loop: contribute, earn rep, claim BIG, use BIG to deepen your influence.



### Earning Reputation (and Why It’s Tiered)

Reputation isn’t one-size-fits-all. It’s tiered — tracked with non-transferable **semi-fungible tokens (SFTs)** that reflect what kind of participant you are. These SFTs are compliant with [SIP-013](https://github.com/stacksgov/sips/blob/main/sips/sip-013/sip-013-semi-fungible-token-standard.md), and act like soul-bound XP:

* Stake early or accurately? You get rewarded.
* Launch quality markets? That earns you more.
* Contribute to governance or dev efforts? That counts too.

As your reputation grows, you unlock more privileges — from governance access to moderation powers.

### A Note on Fairness

Yes, early users have an advantage. That’s true in almost every system. But BigMarket is DAO-governed, and we’ve thought about long-term fairness.

Reputation **can decay** if you're inactive. That means consistent contributors stay relevant — and wallets that just farm once and disappear won't soak up rewards forever.&#x20;
