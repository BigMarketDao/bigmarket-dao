# BigMarket DAO & Token Sale

## **What is the BigMarket DAO?**

BigMarket is more than just a trading platform—it’s governed by a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)**. This means that instead of a central authority making decisions, **BIG token holders** collectively shape the platform's future.

#### **Key Features of the DAO**

✅ **Community-Led Governance**&#x20;

BIG token holders propose and vote on major decisions.\


✅ **Protocol Upgrades**&#x20;

Fees, staking rewards, and market mechanics can be adjusted via governance proposals.\


✅ **Treasury Management**&#x20;

Funds raised through fees and token sales are controlled transparently by the DAO.\


✅ **Decentralization First**&#x20;

No single entity controls BigMarket; decisions are made by the community.
