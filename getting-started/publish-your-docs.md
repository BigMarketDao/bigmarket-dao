* **Bitcoin-first approach** â€“ Built on **Stacks Layer 2**, leveraging Bitcoinâ€™s security.
* **Wallet support** â€“  **Asigna, Leather, and Xverse** wallets are currently supported.
* **Future-ready** â€“ As the Layer 2 Bitcoin ecosystem expands, more wallets and cross-chain support (MetaMask, Phantom, etc.) will be integrated.

### **Connecting Your Wallet**
